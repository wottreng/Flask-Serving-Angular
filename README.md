# Flask-Serving-Angular
Serve angular production application from python flask backend\
flask will serve production app in dist folder\
This makes developement and deployment simple with the Angular frontend UI and Flask backend together in one folder

## build angular app
`ng build` within app folder like normal

## run flask server
when `flaskBackend.py` is run it will edit `index.html` to add static links as url args and serve them as required

Open up `http://localhost:8080/` and production app is served

## update flask server
* `ng build` angular app
* restart `flaskBackend.py` to resync documents
